## magtag_jokes_online

This application allows setting mutliple timers running independently. It is a PWA (prgressive web app), written in Flutter.

This was inspired by an AdaBox hardware project [timers](https://github.com/alpiepho/macropad/tree/master/timers_cp).

## Operation
To start, use the "?" to change the default settings for the multiple timers.  The first section allows for enable/disable of
the various timers.  Just below that are controls to enable-all, set all as count-down timers, set finish-sound on for all,
and set a starting time (currently in milliseconds rather than MM:SS) for all timers.


See below for any known bugs or limits.

## Learnings

Below are some things I learned with this project.

- Started this as a curiousity if a fast Flutter app was possible

## Ongoing Progress

- BASIC IMPLEMENTATION
- [done] start project from flutter create
- [done] modify engine to show "buttons" for each timer

## Known Issues to Fix and TODO
- timer setting is in ms
